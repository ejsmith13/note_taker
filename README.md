  ## Description:


  This project is an app that lets the user take notes and save them for later. It is being deployed on Heroku, and can be accessed [here](https://secret-tor-49153.herokuapp.com/). I was given most of the front end code for this project, but created the mechanisms within the backend to get it working. I realied heavily on Javascript and used a server for the first time while working with an application. This is also the first project I have created that uses a database in the background to store information that the user enters.
